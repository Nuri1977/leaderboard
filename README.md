## Interaction with the Leaderboard API
- Each new game is created with the POST method using
  ```bash
      {
          "name": "My cool new game"
      }
    ```
 This request returns a result that holds the unique ID for that game:

  ```bash
    {
      "result": "Game with ID: Zl4d7IVkemOTTVg2fUdz added."
    }
  ```
>  This gameID is saved in the localStorage automatically


  The two allowed actions are posting and getting of the scores
- The POST request creates a new Leaderboard score for the given game sending user and score as parameters like this:

  #### Endpoint
  ```bash
  https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/games/:id/scores/
  ```

  body parameters
  ```bash
  {
	  "user": "John Doe",
	  "score": 42
  }
  ```
  and it returns

  ```bash
  {
	  "result": "Leaderboard score created correctly."
  }
  ```
- The GET request returns data in JSON format like this:
-
    #### Endpoint
  ```bash
  https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/games/:id/scores/
  ```

    "result": [
        {
            "user": "John Doe",
            "score": 42
        },
        {
            "user": "Jahne Smith",

        },
        {
